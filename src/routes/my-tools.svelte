        My go-to device with which I do any work every day. I am very happy with
        the decision to use macOs instead of Windows for my daily work.

        The best monitor I've ever had. Razor sharp picture and super smooth.
        The speakers and the camera also convince me. Makes a lot of fun to work
        with it.

        A really good keyboard from Apple on which typing for hours is no

        eternity.

        I first had the MX Master 3 of which I was already very convinced
        because it is simply super high quality and the scrolling I also really
        like, but the mouse shape was not so suitable for me, because I prefer
        smaller mice I have chosen the compact variant.

        A really useful IDE that always makes my day. With super advanced
        features like their auto completion it makes my development with laravel

        I also use Figma almost daily to plan and design my UI/UX designs before
        implementation. It is very useful and is highly recommended if you are
        interested in web design.

        Facilitates the work with any databases many times over. I never thought

        Another incredibly handy piece of software from BeyondCode that allows

        This is my favorite of email inboxes so far. Super clean and manageable
        design with lots of features. For daily reading of a few different email
        accounts and sending emails just perfect.

        Definitely one of the better notes and to-do apps I've used in a long
        time. Working with Craft on a daily basis is fun because it's super
        intuitive, easy to use, and has exactly the features you need to
        organize your daily tasks.

        I use this tool mainly to further optimize my workflow with macOS.
        Instant translations, calculations and much more is super fast and easy.
        In short, Spotlight in even better.

        Super useful tool to create and copy precise screen captures very
        quickly or even to record videos and GIFs. I don't know how I did it
